# tor-relay

https://community.torproject.org/relay/

The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more people who
run relays, the better the Tor network will be. The current Tor network is
quite small compared to the number of people who need to use Tor, which means
we need more dedicated volunteers like you to run relays. By running a Tor
relay you can help make the Tor network.
